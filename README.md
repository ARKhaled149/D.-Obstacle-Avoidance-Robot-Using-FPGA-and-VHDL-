# Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot-Using-FPGA-and-VHDL (Nov 2019 - Dec 2019)
We were asked to build something from scratch using FPGA with VHDL. The project should contain 2 different input sensors and output transducers, a total of 4 items. The idea just came to me to make an obstacle avoidance robot. However, we used 3 ultrasonic sensors and one laser sensor. The laser sensor is used so that if you put your hands above the robot it will stop immediately and the ultrasonic is put to cover 120 degreesâ€™ view for each one. The code was written in VHDL. The car was put together, there was 4 motor drives and one H-bridge.
